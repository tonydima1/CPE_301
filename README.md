# CPE_301:
Projects for CPE 301 class.

Sink_Project_Mega.ino:
A project design to be an automatic sink. One places their hands near the sensor the motor (sink) turns on and stays on while the users hands are in range (resets timer).
After the hands are removed the timer clocks down 30 seconds then the motor turns off. LED in this case do to the cable on the motor malfunctioning. With Arduino Mega.
Some reason the push button system sometimes malfunctions. Not an issue with the UNO version.

Sink_Project_UNO.ino:
Same as Sink_Project_Mega.ino, but with an UNO. I am more comfortable with the UNO.
